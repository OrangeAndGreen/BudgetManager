TODOs:

Graphs
	-Shade to 0, not -inf
	-Better color control
	-Date labels on x-axis
	-Smaller graph circles
	-Option to reduce graphs to daily/weekly points
	-Graph type: monthly spending by category
	-Add graph option for all, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
     	Then main selector just becomes Accounts, Categories, Vendors
	-Add a way to disable plots within a graph, i.e. click Net plot in legend to remove it

Cleanup:
	-Investigate failed matching
		-Amazon: see console output
		-10/27/19 and 10/29: $413 paid to credit
		-12/17/19: Amazon -774.67
			Corresponds to two nearby Credit amounts: 587.43, 187.24
	-Investigate entries with no description

Misc TODOs:
	-Background worker
	-Create Account class
	-Change Checking/Savings/Credit amounts to be a list <Account, change>
	-When changes based on user interaction, persist them so I can reconstruct later (i.e. merging Amazon entries to transactions)
	-Auto-select new TransactionType once saved
	-Better category management (i.e. select existing or define new)
		-Separate: think about what categories we really want to break things into
	-Analyze total/monthly spending per vendor
	-Matching transactions list should be a transaction table
	-Match word option for vendor recognition
	-Highlight when a filter is going to conflict
		-Red entries in matching transactions table where there's a conflict
	-Show load warnings, i.e. when a budget start/end balance don't add up
	-DARK MODE!!!
	-Combine identical descriptions in unidentified transaction list
		Sort the list alphabetically, or by count
