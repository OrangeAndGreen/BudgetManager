TODOs:

Things I want to be able to do:
	-Analyze spending habits
	-Assign categories to transactions (automatically with defaults, and user overrides)

Graphs
	-Shade to 0, not -inf
	-Better color control
	-Date labels on x-axis
	-Smaller graph circles
	-Add graph option for all, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
		When not "all", show ribbons for min/max, with averrage line in the middle
     	Then main selector just becomes Accounts, Categories, Vendors (or better, specific Graph Types defined below)
	-Add a way to disable plots within a graph, i.e. click Net plot in legend to remove it
	-Graph types:
		-Accounts
		-Categories
		-Vendors

Merging transactions:
	Instead of currnetly hard-coded list of descriptions to matchup, let the user define this
	Have a merge tool
	Choose two accounts, then identify the patterns in both accounts that lead to matches
		Show match success while this is being defined


Cleanup:
	-Investigate failed matching
		-Amazon: see console output
		-10/27/19 and 10/29: $413 paid to credit
		-12/17/19: Amazon -774.67
			Corresponds to two nearby Credit amounts: 587.43, 187.24
	-Investigate entries with no description

Misc TODOs:
	-Background worker
	-Create Account class
	-Change Checking/Savings/Credit amounts to be a list <Account, change>
	-When changes based on user interaction, persist them so I can reconstruct later (i.e. merging Amazon entries to transactions)
*	-Auto-select new TransactionType once saved
	-Better category management (i.e. select existing or define new)
		-Separate: think about what categories we really want to break things into
.	-Analyze total/monthly spending per vendor
	-Match word option for vendor recognition
	-Remaining dark mode views
